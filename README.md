# My First Smart Contract

A simple Solidity smart contract and test project.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/BlockChain-R/my-first-smart-contract.git
   ```
2. Install the dependencies:

   ```sh
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

### Starting a local blockchain:

To start a local blockchain using Ganache

   ```
   npm run start
   ```
This will start a local blockchain on port 7545

### Compile the smart contract:

   ```
   npm run compile
   ```
This will generate the contract bytecode and ABI in the build/ directory.

### Running tests:

To run the project tests using Jest, run:
   ```
   npm run test
   ```
This will run the tests in the test/ directory. The tests will deploy the contract to the local blockchain and run the tests.
